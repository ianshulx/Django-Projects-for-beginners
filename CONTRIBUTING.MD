<h1>Contributing Guide lines</h1>

Hacktoberfest is an annual worldwide event held during the month of October. The event encourages open source developers to contribute to repositories through pull requests (PR). GitHub hosts many open source repositories that contribute to learning content. Some of the repositories actively participate in the Hacktoberfest event. In this article, you‚Äôll learn how to discover which repos are accepting PRs, and what you can expect as a contributor.

# Contribution Rulesüìö:

- You are allowed to make pull requests that break the rules. We just merge it ;)
- Do NOT add any build steps e.g npm install (we want to keep this a simple static site)
- Do NOT remove other content.
- Styling/code can be pretty, ugly or stupid, big or small as long as it works
- Add your name to the contributorsList file
- Try to keep pull requests small to minimize merge conflicts
