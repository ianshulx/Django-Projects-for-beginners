Introduction
************

``Django-Projects-for-beginners`` is a collaborative collection of beginner-friendly Django projects designed to help developers learn 
the fundamentals of Django web development. Each project showcases essential concepts like models, views, templates, and forms, making it 
an ideal starting point for those new to Django or web development in general.

If you are a beginner, you can check out these projects and contribute your own work as well.


************
What to do ? 
************

* Create a basic Django project, such as a simple blog, a to-do list app, or a basic e-commerce site.
* Add the project folder in this repo.
* Don't Forget to add a requirements.txt file in it.
* Don't use any other framework rather than django.

* For more information on Django, check out the official documentation at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/.
  
*******************
When to Use Django:
*******************

* You need to build a web application quickly: Django’s bundled tools and the automatic admin interface save a lot of development time.
* Your app needs to scale: Django is well-suited for projects that might grow large and require scalability.
* Security is important: Django’s built-in security features make it a great choice for applications that need to handle sensitive data.


************************************
Steps to Contribute in repository:
************************************

* Click the “Fork” button at the top of this repository page to create your own copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
* Clone your forked repository to your local machine to work on it.
* Open a terminal and run:
``git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Django-Projects-for-beginners.git``

* Navigate to project directory.
``cd Django-Projects-for-beginners``

* Before making any changes, create a new branch for your contribution. This keeps your work organized and separate from the main branch:
``git checkout -b my-new-branch``

* Add your Django project or make the necessary changes to the repository.
* Ensure your project follows the Django project structure and includes a requirements.txt file with all necessary dependencies.

* Stage your changes using the following command:
``git add .``

* Commit your changes.
``git commit -m "Relevant message"``

* Push your changes to the new branch in your forked repository:
``git push origin my-new-branch``

* Create a Pull Request (PR):
* Go to your forked repository on GitHub, and you’ll see a “Compare & pull request” button. Click on it to submit your changes.
* Write a detailed description of what you’ve added or changed. Be sure to include the purpose of the contribution and any relevant details about the project.
